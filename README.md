# wormhole-xpay
Get paid from various blockchains easily with your personal xPay payment acceptance page powered by Wormhole xAsset bridge.

With xPay, you can create your own payment acceptance page with your wallet address on your chain (i.e: Solana).
Then share with others, who can then pay from their wallets on other chains without worry about converting, swapping or losing tokens.

## how does xPay work?

xPay works simply by simplifying Wormhole's xAsset bridge workflows and improving its UX.

Lots of steps and uncertainties are reduced to simple straight forward steps.

_For payers_, go to the payment accept page for your payee
- connect your wallet
- select token to send
- enter amount
- then just send it

_For payees_, connect your wallet to access redeem page
- check the VAAs received
- then redeem by clicking buttons (no awkwards inputs needed)

Note: this is possible as VAAs are saved with reference to whom they are designated for.

## improvement suggestion
easy query of VAAs by originating address or destined address would enable xPay concept and many more insteresting use-cases.

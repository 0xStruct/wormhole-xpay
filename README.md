With xPay, you can create your own payment acceptance page with your wallet address on your chain (i.e: Solana).
Then share with others, who can then pay from their wallets on other chains without worry about converting, swapping or losing tokens.

## how does xPay work?

xPay works simply by simplifying Wormhole's xAsset bridge workflows and UXs.

Lots of steps and uncertainties are reduced to simple straight forward steps.

For payers, go to the payment accept page for your payee
- connect your wallet
- select token to send
- enter amount
- then just send it

For payees, login to your dashboard with your wallet
- check the VAAs received
- then redeem by clicking buttons (no inputs needed)

Note: this is possible as VAAs are saved with reference to whom they are designated for.
